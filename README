Network-Python ou Rede de Computadores Python

It's a simulation of a real network made using Python and Google app engine as server side.
Many things have to be improve and I hope my friends can help me. :) 

É uma silulação de uma rede de computadores real usando Python e Google app engine como servidor.
Muitas coisas precisam ser melhorados e espero que meus amigos me ajudem. :)
